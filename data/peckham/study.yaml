        description: As a nonprofit organization that provides employment
            opportunities for persons with disabilities, Peckham is a market
            leader — but it lacked the brand and tools to express this. After
            identifying the organization’s strengths and opportunities, we
            determined that a brand refresh and realignment of Peckham’s vision
            and mission was in order to keep up with direct competitors.

        description: On top of developing a brand that spoke meaningfully to
            both Peckham’s “business” and “mission” arms, we aimed to provide
            everyone — from leadership to those at the front desk — with a
            purpose-driven voice to engender brand loyalty. Across Peckham’s
            varied lines of business, we created an organization-wide brand
            system to support sales and help Peckham compete nationally.

        description: We reflected Peckham’s integrity, drive, and excellence
            through a comprehensive brand system, including a new mark that
            visually represents driving business forward. New brand systems for
            each line of Peckham's business outlined every detail of
            execution. By clarifying best practices across every platform and
            coaching vendors, we were able to ensure strong long-term brand
            deployment.
