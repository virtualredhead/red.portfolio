        description: Charlotte, Michigan is a bedroom community that was in the
            midst of significant revitalization and redevelopment. For their new
            brand, we devoted “secret shopper” time to get a feel for the city’s
            atmosphere, picking up on all of the small details downtown that made up
            the city’s identity. After facilitating brainstorm sessions and focus
            groups with city leaders and residents, we gathered authentic opinions
            regarding the city’s benefits, challenges, and persona.

        description: At Redhead, we follow the key truth that city brands aren’t
            a one-size-fits-all solution. Like all municipalities, Charlotte is
            nuanced, with different subsectors and audiences including residents,
            developers, and neighboring communities. For this reason, we planned a
            series of sub-brands to be used throughout the city, by entities from
            the city proper to economic development groups to placemaking
            organizations. This way, the city has a strong framework and tools to
            help them remain on-brand while keeping up with evolving needs over
            time.

        description: We developed a versatile visual brand and marketing
            strategy for Charlotte that could apply to everything on the city’s
            calendar, from City Hall offices to its annual “PigPalooza” event.
            Rustic, timeless visuals reflected the city’s strong, rural past while
            acknowledging future reinvigoration. Additionally, simple and inviting
            language created a tone that was optimistic and down-to-earth,
            representing the city’s “small-town on the rise” persona. Today, we are
            able to provide ongoing support over time for Charlotte’s new events and
            projects whenever needs arise.
