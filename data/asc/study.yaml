        title: My kind of people
        media: section1.jpg
        description: "When strategizing a city-wide campaign for the City of
            Lansing, in-depth market research led us to one common idea: Lansing's
            residents are what set the city apart. The \"My Kind of People\" campaign
            spotlights residents from across the city through photography and video
            content, giving the audience an engaging mirror in which they can see
            themselves represented–literally. Hip, quirky, serious, or bold, Lansing
            folk are what makes this city great. (That, and dinosaurs.)"

        title: A unifying brand

        description: Lansing's three smokestacks–fondly known as Wynken,
            Blynken, and Nod–have a cult following among residents. We used this
            as inspiration for a lifestyle mark that was fresh and instantly
            recognizable. Branded materials such as apparel, hats, and flags
            sold out quickly in pop-up shops at City Hall. (And social
            engagement about the new mark? Priceless.) A holistic brand platform
            articulates what the city stands for–the values, mission and
            position–as well as brand standards for everyday use across city
            departments and other materials.  This way, the brand is primed for
            community-wide sharing and collaboration.

        title: Articulating a vision
        media: section3.jpg
        description: Working alongside the city's leadership team, we drafted a
            10-year vision for the City of Lansing, from overarching goals down
            to measurable data points. Through a detailed SWOT analysis,
            informal interviews, and a whole lot of research, we gathered
            insight into what residents loved about their city and where they
            saw room for improvement. Aspirational and actionable language
            articulated not only what the city can become, but how it can
            achieve these goals. By publishing this digitally, we were able to
            make the message easily accessible and inspire local government
            participation through a feedback form.
