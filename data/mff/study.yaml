        description: The Michigan Fitness Foundation's previous "They Learn
            From Watching You" campaign aimed to inspire parents in Michigan to
            display healthy nutrition and physical activity decisions to their
            children. We identified the need for a revamped campaign with a
            lighter tone, both visually and through language. This included a
            new name, message, and visual aesthetic.

        description: Through quantitative research we found that, to inspire
            our target audience, we needed straightforward messaging and
            diverse representation. During planning, we conceptualized a
            succinct campaign tagline, as well as billboard and bus wrap
            headlines. We agreed that "Healthy choices catch on" was simple,
            direct, and would serve this campaign well.

        description: "To start, we developed creative campaign concepts for
        three phases: summer, harvest, and holidays. We then organized and art
        directed photoshoots, refined copywriting, and collaborated with
        photographers, models, and vendors. After outlining a comprehensive,
        two-year social media strategy, we created and maintained new social
        accounts and managed digital ad distribution to bring this campaign to
        life."
