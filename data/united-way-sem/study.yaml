        title: It’s about more than a free meal.

        description: We crafted a name and brand that aims to remove the stigma
            from free summer food service. At Meet Up & Eat Up sites, kids (and
            sometimes families) eat, socialize, and have the opportunity to be
            active. More than just a place to eat, they are neighborhood
            engagement centers.

        description: We worked with United Way for Southeastern Michigan and its
            partners to devise a strategy for re-launching the summer food
            service program along with rich digital and printed toolkits. The
            campaign collateral gives the food service sites a robust visual
            platform for awareness and engagement.

        title: Utilizing a good idea, all over.

        description: Meet Up & Eat Up expansions and adoptions are happening
            everywhere—the Michigan Department of Education added a “read up”
            component; we’re in the process of developing a tablet-based meal
            tracking app; the program was immediately embraced as one of the
            Detroit Lions’ signature charities; and other states are negotiating
            to franchise the entire system.
