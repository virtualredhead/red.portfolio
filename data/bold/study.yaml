        description: BOLD Lansing, a collection of finance and education
            partners, came to us with the need for a unified name and
            brand. The primary challenge were uniting five distinct
            entities under a common identity and cause, while finding
            a way to engage target families very early in the
            postsecondary education planning process.

        description: To encourage cohesion, we held meetings to gather
            each partner's perspective regarding the challenges
            associated with encouraging local families to save for
            higher education. This information, along with
            client-collected data, further supported our messaging and
            direction. We landed on a hyper-accessible brand that would
            simplify complex information for families.

        description: After conceptualized a new name and logo for the
            organization that expressed the idea of boldly chasing a strong
            future, we developed two versions of a website to house BOLD
            Lansingâ€™s resources and action plan. This project included
            wholesale content generation, from start to finish, as well as
            social media strategy.
