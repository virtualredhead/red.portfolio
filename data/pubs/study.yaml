        title: Conceptual thinking
        image: section1.jpg
        description: Capturing the soul of an organization means more than
            outlining yearly stats in an annual report. It means developing a
            conceptual layer & narrative that captures the reader. For a client
            like Firecracker Foundation, it means gently (or not) bringing
            readers into the reality of trauma and healing. It means taking them
            through the journey, asking them to imagine, and inspiring them into
            action.

        title: Birthing an annual
        image: section2.jpg
        description: When a client is new to annual reports, we help guide them
            through the process. We suggest innovative way to communicate their
            numbers, dig deep to help them articulate what was notable about the
            year in review, and talk about the goals and call to action that can
            inform the publication's concept. For Habitat for Humanity Capital
            Region, that meant articulating the broad effects of housing
            insecurity in our community, and the many ways the organization
            addresses the problem.

        description: We'll be honest, nothing feels better than well-set
            typography, an clear and organized chart, or strategic white space.
            Small details matter. A lot. And understanding when to go corporate
            or soft or loud or playful? That is based in understanding the
            client deeply, and aligning with their overall goals.
