        description: Some causes require—and evoke—a visceral reaction that is
            deeper than a marketing campaign. Around these parts, ask about The
            Lake, and there is rarely a doubt that you’re talking about Lake
            Michigan. Give lake lovers a way to express their commitment wrapped
            in an ultra-current aesthetic, and it's an obvious win.

        description: A movement means taking action. Our photo frame allows lake
            lovers to express what their hearts are tied to, and encourages them
            to get a little sand between their toes. A properly developed and
            executed hashtag allows community and conversation to build.

        description: MSU has a very thorough and intentional brand. It’s
            important that marketing and editorial materials such as In The
            Field adhere to the brand and enhance it. The challenge then, is to
            develop a piece that has it’s own unique personality yet supports
            the university’s overarching goals. We work very carefully to ensure
            that our creativity exists within the bounds of the brand. It’s a
            fun challenge. (Most of us are Spartans, after all!)
