        title: Positioning and research

        description: Nothing feels better than a good SWOT analysisâ€”it clarifies
            your thinking and it uncovers contradictory perceptions. Combined
            with a deep dive into strategic goals and competitive landscape. We
            started by recommending a rename with a purpose: taking Capital Area
            Career Center to Wilson Talent Center, naming the school after a beloved
            former board member.

        description: With a new name and a fresh new energy for helping students
            get a jump on their credentials, we helped Wilson freshen outreach
            materials and succinctly tell their story to the schools and students
            they serve. A sophisticated yet energetic color palette and a clear
            positioning statement confirm Wilson as a stepping stone to both
            college and technical careers.

        description: Ensuring a client has the tools and tactics to successfully
            implement a brand long-term is perhaps just as important as getting the
            brand right in the first place, and helping subsequent partners deploy
            materials that are true to vision. The result? A strong, refined, and
            confident new outlook for a school that is turning out impressive grads.
            All-around win.
