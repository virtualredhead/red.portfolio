        description: Michigan College Access Network (MCAN) — an organization
            that aims increase college completion in Michigan, particularly among
            low-income students and students of color — had become a national
            leader within the college access space. But its clunky website and
            marketing assets didn’t reflect that. From visuals to language,
            everything needed a ground-up overhaul.

        description: After conducting internal focus groups, we recommended
            that expand into the broader benefits of equity and access for both
            students and our state. From this, we determined a path to position
            how MCAN increases equity through college access. With this, the
            network could realign its brand to reflect the driven internal culture
            that was its reality.

        description: "We took on an entire overhaul of MCAN’s web presence,
            including improved content organization and a responsive, ADA-compliant
            system. New brand executions prepped MCAN with the tools it need to
            enter its next decade of service. With this rebrand, MCAN was able to
            refocus on the core of its mission: building equity through college
            access."
