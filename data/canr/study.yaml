        title: From the ground up

        description: Designing the inaugural issue of a publication requires a solid
            base of strategy, lots of creativity, a dose of efficiency and logic, a heap
            of technical skill, and a generous portion of great collaboration. (That last
            bit is easy when your clients are awesome.) While there were many beautiful
            pubs coming out of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at
            Michigan State University, there wasn’t one that was representational of the
            college as a whole. So our task was to help develop a flagship print piece
            to fill the gap.

        description: Conceptualizing the perfect name, working to develop a
            cover and flag that set the proper tone, envisioning what can be
            done with photography to support editorial as well as intrigue the
            viewer. Those are some of the first steps. Planning for content
            flow, word counts, paper, page size and binding. Developing
            thoughtful solutions for every piece of content, from table of
            contents to folio. A hundred small decisions matter and affect the
            end result.

        title: Honoring the brand
        image: book.jpg
        description: MSU has a very thorough and intentional brand. It’s
            important that marketing and editorial materials such as In The
            Field adhere to the brand and enhance it. The challenge, then, is to
            develop a piece that has its own unique personality yet supports
            the university’s overarching goals. We work very carefully to ensure
            that our creativity exists within the bounds of the brand. It’s a
            fun challenge. (Most of us are Spartans, after all!)
