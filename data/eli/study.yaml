        description: A website is arguably an organization's most relevant and
            powerful marketing tool. When planning a website overhaul for Eli
            Broad College of Business at Michigan State University, we
            identified a gap between the College's top-ranked status and its
            online presence.  Collaborating with the client, organizing a strong
            information architecture, and conducting research with our target
            market were all critical for planning a website based on user needs,
            rather than on guesswork or institutional design. (Revolutionary, we
            know.)

        title: Identifying creative solutions

        description: We believe strongly that all aspects of a website are
            interconnected, and should be considered holistically. Photography
            choices, rhetoric, design, development, and business goals should
            all work together. With the Broad website, we maintained a focus on
            technology, design, and marketing strategy, as one of these factors
            simply couldn't exist without the others. This involved designing a
            fresh, straightforward interface and drafting engaging, search
            engine-optimized content. Together with the client, we were able to
            condense 20+ sites with 1000+ pages down to one cleaner, more
            effective, and efficient presence.

        title: Prioritizing ease of use
        media: section3.jpg
        description: We believe in accessibility as best practice. In good
            documentation. In logical site mapping and content hierarchy. For
            Broad's site, front-end and back-end development promoted a seamless
            experience for administrative users to continually update. From an
            end-user standpoint, an amped-up news presence allowed for more
            timely and dynamic contentâ€“because a website should never be a
            stationary presence.
