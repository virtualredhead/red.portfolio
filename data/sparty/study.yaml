        description: "As Michigan State University's beloved mascot Sparty
          entered his 30th year, the MSU Alumni Office approached us to update
          his branding guidelines. Sparty has a fearless, lovable persona
          recognized throughout the state and country, and as such, we
          determined the new brand book needed to serve a dual purpose: first,
          preserve Sparty's status as one of the most recognized and popular
          mascots in the nation, and second, articulate Sparty's tone of
          voice."

        description: "What better way to learn brand rules than from Sparty in
          his own voice? (A question we had trouble answering.) In order to
          craft a first-person brand book, we devoted time to research,
          conceptualization, and drafting the right tone. The result was casual
          and welcoming; prideful and cartoonish; and timeless, with
          tongue-in-cheek humor. Thus, Sparty's voice was born, and the
          first-person language of the brand book became a case in point of
          Sparty's holistic identity."

        description: "To apply Sparty's first-person point of view, we took the
          existing framework of a technical brand book and gave it a Sparty
          twist, cheeky comments and all. Sparty prohibits use of former mascot
          costume images because \"not everyone likes looking through old
          photos.\" Using this tone of voice, we expanded the Sparty brand in
          follow-up projects including an activity book and greeting cards.
          Sparty's tone not only made the brand book and its subsequent
          materials more engaging, but allow his big boisterous personality to
          shine through in a variety of mediums. Now, along with his renowned
          visual identity, Sparty is unmistakeable in the written form."
