        description: "Michigan State University Federal Credit Union (MSUFCU) is
          a financial institution with a strong reputation in and around its
          community. While its original look had served it well for more than 40
          years, this visual system was no longer practical from an
          accessibility and scalability standpoint. We got to work developing a
          new logo and subsequent visual system."

        description: "We knew MSUFCU's mark needed to strike a careful balance
          between its energetic, playful personality and its trustworthy,
          dependable corporate responsibilities. We created a new mark with
          three lines to hint at the \"M\" in MSUFCU's form, while symbolizing its
          commitment to members, employees, and the community. Lowercase,
          hand-rendered typography promoted legibility and helped convey the
          client's welcoming yet professional tone."

        description: "Because of MSUFCU's broad membership (ranging in age from
          teens to those 100+), we developed launch tactics for the new mark
          that were deliberate, considerate, and steady. Language like \"Same
          dreams, new look\" expressed that, while MSUFCU was refreshing its
          visual presence, its core identity was remaining untouched. With this
          launch, MSUFCU was able to stay true to its roots while introducing a
          modern look that will serve it well for decades to come."
