        description: The arts offer an opportunity to design outside the
            norm â€” but striking a balance between avant-garde and accessiblity
            is where strategy comes in. With Wharton Center for Performing
            Arts, an elegant existing brand set the stage for our own artistic
            expression through print and digital season books, which we
            organized with logic and strategy.

        description: In the entertainment industry, the world is your
            competition; though distinctly different, live theatre competes for
            audience eyes alongside everything from the local basketball game
            to the latest Netflix series. Therefore, we immediately understood
            that this catalog was about more than sharing information. It was
            about gathering mindshare and building relevancy for the experience
            of live theatre.

        description: For each catalog, we developed a consistent and cohesive
            narrative that would seamlessly blend both print and digital
            pieces. Contemporary cover design kept pace with the performing
            arts industry to attract new audiences, and emotion-driven content
            mimicked the intimate experience of live theatre. Just like the
            arts themselves, this project was a tool to evoke action and
            engagement.
