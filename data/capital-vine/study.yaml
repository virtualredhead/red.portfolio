        title: Developing a Look and a Personality

        description: A restaurant brand is an immersive experience. Brand,
            marketing materials, physical space, menu, and experience work in
            concert to leave patrons with the right vibe. For Capital Vine, we
            developed a sensual yet sophisticated mark—a minimal take on a wine
            bottle and glass—as the foundation.

        description: Typography is as carefully curated as the wine list.
            Materials from menu to promotional piece and comment cards give
            patrons a cue regarding the level of experience they'll enjoy. Small
            details close the loop and add the perfect garnish.

        description: Social media calls for great headlines and a clear brand
            presence, well timed to remind the target market that Capital Vine
            is the perfect place for happy hour or evening cocktails or Sunday
            brunch. (And wowie do they have a great brunch. We recommend the
            Bloody Mary bar.)
