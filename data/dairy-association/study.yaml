        title: Tricky audiences mean clever solutions
        image: mail.jpg
        description: Teens in Michigan—particularly girls—don’t get nearly
            enough calcium to keep their rapidly growing bones healthy. And
            while relying on Mom to chide, “drink your milk!” is indeed a
            tried-and-true method, it’s not always enough. Enlisting the support
            of pediatricians to open the door to this mercurial market was the
            way to go, and direct mail was the best vehicle.

        description: From researching the psychology of teen girls to
            problem-solving the geometry of packaging to wordsmithing a
            compelling message, we aced all the AP courses on this one. We also
            developed strategy for turning what would have been a one-time
            interaction with teens into an ongoing social media engagement.

        description: What do teens need? Support and celebration of what makes
            them great, an empowering tone, and some easy nutrition information.
            Campaign language and an aesthetic specifically crafted to resonate
            with Generation Z means the client is helping to build strong bones
            now, and cultivating a new generation of milk purchasers for later.
