        description: At a major university like MSU, a robust research portfolio
            is expected. It’s even more impressive when conducted by scholars in
            their very first years. We helped the client outline opportunities
            for potential students and showcase some superstars doing research
            today.

        description: Robust web applications are like icebergs—massive and
            powerful parts are hidden beneath the surface. Building
            database-heavy applications is one of our favorite things. The goal?
            Elegant function that is easy to navigate and digest on the user
            side of the equation.

        description: A Big Ten university and a Fortune 500 company team up and
            Redhead gets to help? Neat. Overarching theme, digital and print
            collateral, plus details down to the nametags? Check. Strategy,
            consultation, design, and web development? Check. Three teams
            partnering to build a successful first-year event? Yah, that
            happened too.
