        title: We Love Babies (and advocacy)
        media: stands.jpg
        description: Breastfeeding can be a fraught topic and a difficult
            challenge for many families. Further, misinformation and
            misperceptions can hinder, rather than support, new moms in their
            breastfeeding efforts. So it was important that our campaign for the
            Ingham County Health Department both empower families to start and
            continue breastfeeding, as well as change community perception.

        title: Research & Messaging
        media: detail.jpg
        description: We talked to a lot of moms, and (no surprise) they hated
            being judged for their feeding choicesâ€”breast or bottle. It was also
            apparent that much of the existing breastfeeding messaging felt
            aspirational and artificial. Our campaign message took a more
            down-to-earth tone to better reflect the realities of breastfeeding.
            Clever headlines also reinforcing to the casual viewer that
            breastfeeding in public is legal, healthy, and normal.

        title: Moms for the Win
        media: web.jpg
        description: Photography of nursing families in our community added an
            authenticity stock photos could never achieve, and brought real-life
            advocates and role models to the conversation. And wow, was there
            conversation. Billboards sparked a public debate that immediately
            spread throughout social media and garnered earned media. Better
            yet, inquiries for breastfeeding support increased for the client
            immediately, which means more women and families are getting the
            support they need to successfully breastfeed. Win!
