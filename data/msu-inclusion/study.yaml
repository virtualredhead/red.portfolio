        title: Balancing awareness with attention.

        description: Sexual assault prevention is a sensitive topic. For many
            students, the definitions are fuzzy. They shouldn’t be. We
            visualized those blurred lines via images of tipping point scenarios
            for the occurrence of sexual assault. Paired with the firm “no
            excuse” mantra, the campaign makes a sharp point.

        description: How do you reach over 49 thousand students? By giving them
            options. Tactile mediums like buttons, water bottles, t-shirts,
            balloons, stickers, and banners give the campaign travelling legs
            and spur questions—where real discourse and change can occur.

        description: It certainly takes more than a good headline, posters, and
            tchotchkes to enact change. Social media tools allow engagement with
            MSU students at a more personal level. Ad placements promoting
            events invite students to join the movement and be part of the
            solution.
