        description: "The Ingham County Health Department came to us with
            statistics supporting an overwhelmingly common public health issue:
            Many women devote so much time to supporting their families that
            they aren't able to focus on themselves, leading to a number of
            physical and mental health risks. Women who lack travel
            resources or are pressed for time are especially at-risk. Our
            task was to create a multi-media campaign to increase awareness
            about women's health–convincing women to make time for their own
            well-being, for a change."

        description: Launching a multi-media campaign is a lot more than sharing
            content across as many mediums as possible. It requires meeting your
            target market where they are, and communicating in a way that fits
            their lifestyles. Simplicity was the answer; it only takes a few
            words in the middle of a woman's busy day to make a difference, so
            we kept messaging succinct. By translating content into multiple
            languages, we were able to effectively reach a variety of audiences.

        description: "A funny thing happens when the audience is able to see
            themselves represented in a marketing campaign: they listen. Custom
            photography showcased local women from multiple demographics. We
            made a point to display a variety of moods, from joy to
            contemplation, to demonstrate the complexity of our target audience.
            Across many of our campaigns, honesty and authenticity resonate.
            Because–surprise–they work."
