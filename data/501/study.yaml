        description: "<a href=\"https://lansing501.com/\">Lansing 5:01</a> is an
            initiative driven to retain and attract residents to the Greater
            Lansing, Michigan region. Our task? To unite a number of small
            municipalities into one cohesive region through Lansing 5:01’s new
            website, emphasizing each area’s unique appeal whilst proving a strong
            case for the broader region as an ideal place for young professionals to
            settle down."

        description: We started by researching and brainstorming the qualities
            of the Greater Lansing region that have potential to attract young
            talent. When we nailed down these factors (such as attainable housing
            and nightlife), we partnered with a photographer who could provide
            exceptional photography to set a mood to tonally articulate the vibe of
            the region. By stripping away preconceived notions about the area, we
            created a global, holistic view of what Greater Lansing has to offer.
            This fresh perspective and modern visual tone ignored any pre-existing
            divisions and, instead, presented the region as the large metropolitan
            leader it is.

        description: "When developing Lansing 5:01’s website, we devoted a
            significant amount of time to planning navigation. We organized
            “Community” pages in a way that would appeal to both prospective
            residents and local leaders. For the site’s “Amenity” pages, we
            identified assets that would be important to prospective residents and
            wrote original copy that set the tone for the region’s forward-looking
            persona. By developing a logical method for young talent to connect with
            local employers through the site, we brought the client’s vision of
            boosting the local economy full-circle. (Bonus points? The site is
            award-winning — earning a Silver at the 2020 American Advertising Awards
            local chapter.)"
