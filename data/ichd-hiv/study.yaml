        description: "Ingham County Health Department (ICHD) provides accessible
            community health services. After working with the department on
            several campaigns in the past, ICHD reached out for support on a
            new campaign to encourage HIV testing and treatment. First, we
            needed to address the root challenge: reducing the stigma
            associated with HIV."

        description: "We first conducted extensive research through focus
            groups, meetings with health professionals, and one-on-one
            interviews with people living with HIV. One common thread we
            noticed: Our target audience was not defined by HIV. Thus,
            [""This is life with HIV""](https://lifewithhiv.org) — a
            campaign to emphasize that those living with HIV can still live
            full, vibrant lives — was born."

        description: We designed a website, billboards, and social posts
            featuring custom photography of real people living with HIV who
            were willing to share their advice and stories. Audience-specific
            messaging addressed the most common obstacles to testing and
            treatment, and concepts for guerrilla marketing tactics aimed to
            reach those who needed to hear the message most.
