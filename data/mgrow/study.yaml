        description: It’s one of our favorite things. We took inspiration from
            the art world to remind residents that all sorts of “beauty
            aids”—from nail polish to lawn fertilizer—often have results that
            aren’t so pretty for the natural environment.

        description: For this small coalition who didn’t have tons of campaign
            experience, we created a suite of print and digital assets, prepped
            a social media plan, and coached them on best practices for campaign
            execution.

        description: A simple website with a few clear messages is often more
            impactful than a giant, meandering presence. This coalition was
            already represented by six comprehensive sites, so the campaign url
            functions as a portal that teaches and refers.
