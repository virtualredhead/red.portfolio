        title: Finding a new name that fits
        media: section1.jpg
        description: Render Studios has had 35 years of success in the books
            under the name of Such Video when they came to us for a rebrand and
            to help position the company. When you've had a successful history
            and dependable brand, change is not to be taken lightly. Our taskâ€”to
            develop a new name and wrap-around brand platform. We started with
            deep research into existing brand perceptions and the principal's
            aspirations for the next 35 years.

        description: What makes a brand unique? What makes their offerings any
            better or worse than the next guy? Audiences need to know. We helped
            Render's leadership articulate their vision in a way that accurately
            represented where they wanted to go, inspired their team,
            capitalized on their very best qualities and narrated their journey
            and successes.

        title: Getting the launch right
        media: section3.jpg
        description: A brand relaunch is a distinct opportunity to re-engage
            existing audiences. It allows loyalists to reconsider and reinvest
            in their affinity for what you offer. It's also an opportune moment
            to capture mindshare with new audiences. From getting internal
            audiences on board to timing direct mail and digital launch
            precisely, elegance and planning are crucial and no detail is too
            small. Here's to another 25 years of beautiful video from Render
            Studios.
